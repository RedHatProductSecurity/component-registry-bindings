# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project is kept in version sync with the Component Registry project, see the
[version policy](TUTORIAL.md#component-registry-compatibility) and thus a lot of
versions don't bring ground breaking changes and they rather update
the API endpoints. In such cases the version is listed without any
additions/changes/deletions.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased
